		<h2>Jeroo Content</h2>
	
			<h3>Fenced-In Lab</h3>
			<p>The Fenced-In Lab is the first lab we did. This lab is designed to teach us how Jeroo works by using objects and the environment.</p>
			
			<h3>Nets Lab</h3>
			<p>The Nets Lab is also made to teach us how we can use objects in Jeroo to manipulate the environment.</p>
			
			<h3>Diamond Lab</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this lab is to show us that repetition takes a while. It also teaches us how to manipulate the Jeroo as it spawns in.</p>
			
			<h3>The Box Lab</h3>
			<p>The Box Lab is designed to show us how to make basic method statements to make the code more clean.</h2>
			
			<h3>The Water Lab</h3>
			<p>This lab is created with the purpose of teaching us how to use methods to avoid things in the Jeroo's environment, such as water or nets.</p>
			
			<h3>The LED Lab</h3>
			<p>The LED Lab goes more into depth on how we can use methods to clean up code. For this lab, we had to use different methods to create different shapes</p>
			
			<h3>Flower Lab</h3>
			<p>The Flower Lab is designed to make us more comfortable with methods while using manipulated preconditions.</p>
			
			<h3>The Escape Lab</h3>
			<p>The Escape Lab is a challenging lab because we have 4 Jeroos to control, but they are controlled with only one method. It teaches us problem-solving skills</p>
			
			<h3>The Pinball Lab</h3>
			<p>The Pinball Lab is designed to teach us how to use Jeroo methods to avoid water but also loop things.</p>
			
			<h3>Flower Lab 2</h3>
			<p>The second Flower Lab is similar to the first Flower Lab, but this time it has water around the island so we need to use methods to avoid conditions.</p>
			
			<h3>Spiral Lab</h3>
			<p>The Spiral Lab teaches us how to use a single loop to perform tasks in different directions.</p>
			
			<h3>The Water Lab</h3>
			<p>This lab was designed with the intent of combining loops, methods, and if statements to solve a problem</p>
			
			<h3>Lockup Lab</h3>
			<p>This lab shows us how to breakup larger tasks into smaller ones in order to solve a complicated problem</p>
			
			<h3>Chaos Lab</h3>
			<p>This lab teaches you how to use many if statements in a single method to navigate through complicated islands.</p>
			
			<h3>Recursive Lab</h3>
			<p>This lab challenges you to make your code as compact as possible by using loops, methods, and if statements.</p>
			
			<h3>Spiral Lab</h3>
			<p>The spiral lab is designed to force you to make your code adaptive for multiple conditions, as you have to use the same script for 3 different islands.</p>
			
			<h3>Alley Run Lab</h3>
			<p>The Alley Run lab is a complicated lab allowing only one movement per loop and requiring multiple conditionals per loop.</p>
